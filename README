# TA-httpry
Splunk Technology Adapter for httpry
TA-httpry 1.0.4
httpry Technology adapter and supporting scripts
I believe this supports all versions of splunk (tested up to version 6.6.2)  If you have problems please submit version of splunk so I can attempt to duplicate the problem.

This application is primarily supported via the following methods
https://github.com/AlaskaSSO/TA-httpry
https://answers.splunk.com/app/questions/3666.html

This application is under the CC BY-SA 3.0 license EXCEPT for one part which is under the GPL 2.0 license:

This app includes a modified version of httpry_logger.pl, this has been modified to grab the necessary fields.
The source of this application is here: https://github.com/mcholste/elsa/blob/master/contrib/httpry_logger.pl
That code is released under the GPL 2.0 license.

ChangeLog 1.0.3
License change (CC BY-SA 3.0)

This is a COMPLICATED TA;  it includes a web category lookup feature.  I will likely split that feature off into its own application in the future.  httpry does not provide a "category" hence the script the included categorizer and script to update the category yourself. 

This application is meant to quickly provide a basic set of data for Splunk Enterprise Security.  (or any other application that uses the Common Information Model).

TA-httpry provides several different views into the same data, if you do NOT want this data populating your ES console please do the following:
copy tags.conf from default to local and then comment out the tags that you do not want to be loaded up.

This complies with the Web CIM (tag web, tag proxy)
#tags = web proxy


This TA expects field layout to be as follows (and the supporting script generates that):
|src_ip|src_port|dest_ip||dst_port|method|host|request_uri|referer|user_agent|status_code|content_length|content_type|content_language|server|x_flash_version|content_disposition|x_powered_by|cookie||

instructions on how to generate those logs:
Step 1;
You need a linux box with a interface that can monitor traffic
Step 2;
You need to install httpry on the sniffer box with some scripts I've included
copy all files from the ./README/snifferbox to your box that is doing the sniffing
modify /etc/httpry.config and change host and from_host
/usr/local/bin/httpry_logger.pl is a modified perl script that was written by mcholste@gmail.com and is currently located at:
https://github.com/mcholste/elsa with the following url https://github.com/mcholste/elsa/blob/master/contrib/httpry_logger.pl
For this to work you will need my modifications;  the original won't work.  You can diff the original and my copy to see the modifications.
install httpry from http://dumpsterventures.com/jason/httpry/
you are going to need to install a bunch of pre-req's for both the perl app and the shell script
you will need to modify /usr/local/bin/run-httpry;  change the destination IP address and port to your syslog server
Step 3;
Don't forget to set the executable bit for the cron.daily/run-httpry script and the /usr/local/bin/httpry_logger.pl script!

Then edit your syslog server (sample is included for syslog-ng);  Now you have web logs from sniffing the network on your syslog server.   Consume them as desired from your splunk server.
